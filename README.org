* Input data 
The input data for this analysis can be found here:

http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3989261

* File structure
This repo (post) should sit inside a parent folder. It will look in this parent folder for indata/ (the above data unzipped). Running the first analysis (000_lifetables.R) should create some working and output directories in the parent directory also.

* Dependencies & analysis order

This analysis was run in R version 3.6.2.

Please see 000_lifetables.R and 00_utilities.R for packages that should be installed prior to running.

The files should be run in the order of the bash scrip runall.sh. In a un*x environment, one could be ambitious and simply run this script (it may take a while). It would probably be more sensible to run each script in turn. The intended order is by the digit prefix, omitting 00_utilities.R, which is used by the following files. Finally, Tables.R and Figures.R should be run.
